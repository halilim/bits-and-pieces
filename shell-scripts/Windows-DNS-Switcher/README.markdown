Windows DNS Switcher
=======================

Changing DNS server addresses in Windows is quite a pain in the a**. This little script tries to help this a bit.

#### How to use

 * Copy the DNS-Switcher.jse file anywhere you like (can be somewhere in the D: drive if you don't want to lose it after the next format)
 * Preferably make a shortcut of it in the quick launch, desktop, or your choice of shortcut container
 * Right click the file and choose "Open in the command line" or something like it
 * Choose from the list
 * To cancel while the script is running, press Ctrl + C

#### Modification

 * You can add new servers to the array at the top. They will be available in the next run.
 * You can modify any part under the terms of GPL licence, but please contribute it back here.
